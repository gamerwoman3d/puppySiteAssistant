Construction Phase to Deliverable

build an SRS software requirement specification
write all the benefits and features we want to have in this project
take off the features and benefits and divide it up into one week sprints

create ui
create database
tracks your progress and keep up with the deadlines
--The intended use of the puppySiteAssistant is to track the progress of creating the puppySiteAssitant and the puppySite
sprints iterations over time 
focus on process to get to product through sprint iterations

"use the bug tracker that you're building to track the progress on your own project"

with the progress as you 
take srs take weekly sprints
show it with the project you built ans show them how you went through the construction phase [in the init next meeting and followup interview]

"Honestly if you are working a project sprint on a SRS and used the SRS software on the project as you built it, that is next level" but that's what we're trying to do.

follow an architectural or design pattern [how you organize your files and your folders on your disk to produce websites]
repeatable process
easy to debug, fix, and maintain

crud options - it has to have create, write, read, update, delete.
crud options - like to have admin ability to edit, and archive.
